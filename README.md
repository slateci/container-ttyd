# SLATE ttyd container

This repository contains the container for ([SLATE ttyd application](https://github.com/slateci/slate-ttyd)), which is the entrypoint for the container. The container packages all dependencies so that the SLATE client can be executed within the container, so that the terminal exposed through ttyd will allow to execute slate commands.
